# python-lowest-cost-path-in-graph-with-negative-cycles
This Python program, given a graph and a starting node, determines: whether each node other than the starting node is unreachable, whether each reachable node has no minimum cost, and the minimum cost of each reachable node which has a minimum

This Python program counts the number of strongly connected components in a directed graph. The first line of input has two space delimited integers, the number of vertices n and the number of edges m. Each subsequent line of m lines of input has two space delimited integers u and v for a directed edge from u to v.
